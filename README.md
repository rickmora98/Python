Repository: python-challenge 

This repository contains my solutions to Data Analytics Bootcamp Homework Assignment #3.

Main Folders:

"PyBank" contents:
	"main.py": python script for the profit analysis part of the assignment
	"Resources": folder containing file "budget_data.csv" (input file)
	"Analysis": folder containing file "budget_summary.txt" (output file)


"PyPoll" contents:
	"main.py" python script for the election analysis part of the assignment.
  	"Resources": folder containing file"election_data.csv" (input file)
	"Analysis": folder containing file "election_summary.txt" (output file)

Notes:

The python scripts rely on relative path referencing, therefore the folders "Resources" 
and "Analysis" should not be deleted, moved, or renamed.  Also, the input files must be
present in the "Resources" folders and not be renamed.
If the output files already exist in the "Analysis" folders prior to executing the code,
they will be replaced by the new output files.
